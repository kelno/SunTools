## SunWaypoints
SunWaypoints is a tool made to easily transfer path points from `waypoint_data` into `waypoints`.
All you need is to provide the creature entry that will receive the path and the path id from `waypoint_data`.


### To do
* Display a message on error and success.
* Change the PathID input in error mode if the path is empty.
